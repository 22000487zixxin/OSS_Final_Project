This is a website that collects club information in Handong University developed with RaspberryPi for the Final Project for Open Source Software Lab.

## Motivation + Necessity of Website
At the beginning of the semester, clubs post various recruiting and promotional posts, but there were many people who didn't know exactly what clubs there were, and there are still many clubs that some students haven't figured out what activities each club is doing. I also don't know what clubs are in Handong University yet, and I thought it was necessary to let friends like me know what clubs are in Handong University and what activities are going on. Also, if it is used well, I think it can be a good promotional tool at the club level.

## Contents of Website

* The types of clubs in Handong University
